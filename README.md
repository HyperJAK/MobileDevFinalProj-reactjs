# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts for main web

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`  

etc...(rest of command at bottom)

# Mobile Dev Project
Web created using ReactJs, it tests user login / logout to Db and implements multiple security layers for safe Data storage.

<details>
<summary>SQL Script for Db: (Needs to be edited)</summary>
<br>  

```sql
create database compsecdb;
use compsecdb;
create table users(
id int primary key auto_increment,
name varchar(255),
email varchar(255),
title varchar(255),
department varchar(255),
status varchar(255),
position varchar(255),
 picture varchar(500),
 allowed boolean
);

create table account(
id int primary key auto_increment,
email varchar(255),
password varchar(400),
users_id int,
 FOREIGN KEY (users_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

</details>

<summary>Commands to run web and server:</summary>

-Web: for now its (not in server dir)

```

#

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
